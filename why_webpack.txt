- Why Webpack?
	- Explicit Dependencies are great
	- Vendor bundles and global dependencies made easy.
	- Plugins offer useful and standard interfacing with the compile process
	- There's a loader for anything you want. [es6, jsx, scss, elm]
	- Tree Shaking Bundles with require.ensure()
	- Fingerprinting and cache busting with bundle/chunk hashing.
